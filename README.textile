h1. Linux on Compaq T20

h4. I am developing on Ubuntu 9.10. YMMV with other distros

* See "project on google docs":http://docs.google.com/View?id=dcfcvm9s_23gs32zshc

* See "Karl Mowatt-Wilson's original tutorial":http://mowson.org/karl/evo_t20/

* To be able to run 'automated_build.sh', you will need to separately download and extract a copy of the WinNT flash image for an Evo 96/128 (U96CPQ163.bin) to the repo folder.
* (If you need a different version, the scripts will still work, and are not hard to change.)
